# Hello!

------

This website is meant to be an study supplement for Carleton University students taking Math Courses. It does not contain actual study material, but it does contain notes on the math topics that may help you in understanding the individual math topics. I will assume that you have already taken lectures/classes on each topic and just want to understand the concepts in a less "math classy" way.

I do not promise that all the study material is of my own work. If it is not, you will clearly find that the material is a link to a third party source, or you will find the credits to contributing authors at the bottom of the document. Citations will not be in the main content of any file as the main focus of this website is to provide a study supplement for you!

Contributions are welcome! Please either submit a [pull request](https://github.com/ThomasShih/CU_MathResources) or send me an email at thomasshih@cmail.carleton.ca.

Math is challenging, but it is not impossible! Good luck to you in your studies and may you ace your exams!

(Links to study banks/past quizzes and exams will never be included in the resources tab, ask your friends if you want to engage in legally grey activities) 😉 

# **This is resources is only meant to be a "SparkNotes" of what you need to learn. You will still need to visit the resources provided and do your own practice to fully understand the concepts**
